This is a class project from my junior year in college for my software development class.

This project is an interpreter for a mock programming language X. It takes a program’s source code, breaks it up into readable pieces, and properly executes each line. 

There are two example programs that are written in this mock language X: one that computes the nth Fibonacci number, and one that finds the factorial of a number. When entering in a small number, the program will properly calculate the result and print it out for you. All that needs to be done to run these files is to add their title as a program argument in the configuration’s menu.

For importing instructions / further details of the code, please see Documentation.
